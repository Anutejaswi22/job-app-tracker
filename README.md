# Job Application Tracker 💼📬

This is a personal project I built to automatically track job applications using the Gmail API.  
It scans your Gmail inbox for job application and rejection emails, and updates beautiful HTML pages (`applied.html`, `rejected.html`) for quick reference.

### 📌 Features
- Uses Gmail API to fetch job-related emails
- Parses email body for job title, company, and status
- Categorizes emails into `Applied`, `Rejected`, or `In Progress`
- Updates user-friendly HTML dashboard

### 🔐 Warning
This project uses Gmail API credentials.  
Do **NOT** share your `credentials.json`, `token.json`, or any personal email data publicly!
